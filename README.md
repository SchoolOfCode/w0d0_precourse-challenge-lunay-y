## Van Gogh Tribute Page    
I chose to make a tribute page specifically regarding Van Gogh because his painting style has always fascinated me together with his tragic life and the hardships he went through also as an artist.

I have struggled quite a bit to make the Self-portrait image of Van Gogh to be responsive and aligned to its quote. I used flex-boxes however I still feel like that I have not fully grasped how to use them. The Image is still not close enough to the quote when horizontally aligned, however if the screen is too small the image and the quote align on top of each other and that works well.

I decided to make the page inspired by the current minimalistic trend present in modern websites (ie. apple, microsoft) where the spaces are separated by differences in background color and different content are put in boxes that have greysh colors and sharp edges. I also picked a color scheme that is closer to the paintings I decided to showcase (light blue/transparent blue).

I really wanted a slideshow for the paintings in the Art Gallery section, I tried hard to come up with my own solution but eventually I had to look up online. The code I copied is still not understandable with my current skills, however I managed to implement it into my code and adapt it to my needs.

I feel like that my code could have been much cleaner and organised, better naming for classes and IDs, better way to select the selectors for the CSS rules but with my current knowledge I am not sure how to improve it.

This excersise was good to put into practice the things I have learned so far and it made me realize how much more I need to learn.
